# A Star Algroithm
### An path planning 
Introduction: [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.

### Run Demo with Python   

- Solution to run the Demo
  ```bash
  python a_star_original.py
  # or you can run the following (the a_star_noted.py is the noted code with explaination)
  python a_star_noted.py
  ```
